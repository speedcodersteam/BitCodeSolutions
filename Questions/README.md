# These are the questions.
Each directory will contain a single problem. The question itself will be inside the README.md of the directory. 
So, it would be very easy for you to see them. 
Each member will write their solution code, and upload the code into a new directory under that.
Try to add a README.md , cause it would be very easy for everybody to understand your code.
  
## Important
Feel free to use any programming language. (Eg: **Java** or **C++**)
If the user's input is not correct, you should throw an exception. For those who are unfamiliar with exception handling, just print an Error message.
