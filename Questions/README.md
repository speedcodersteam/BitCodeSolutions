# These are the questions.
Each directory will contain a single problem. The question itself will be inside the README.md of the directory. 
So, it would be very easy for you to see them. 
Each member will write their solution code, and upload the code into a new directory under that.
Try to add a README.md , cause it would be very easy for everybody to understand your code.

Happy coding... :)
