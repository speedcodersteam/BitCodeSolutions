# Providing subsidies
Difficulty: Easy

The government will provide one month's dry ration bag as a subsidy to low-income labs. There are 5 main observations to consider.  
    
1. Monthly Income Less than Rs. 10000  
2. Having 4 or more family members.  
3. Having 3 school age children.  
4. Having a vehicle.  
5. Determines whether there is a loan installment of Rs.5000 to be paid per month.  
    
If the given facts are true then use the **X** mark and if it is false then use the **O** mark.  
In order to be eligible for the concession, the first requirement must be met.  
The other 4 factors are that the amount of the concession will gradually increase from 1000 to 5000 depending on the true falsehood.  
Write a program to calculate the exact amount claimed for the subsidy.

### Input Format
1. Each line carries five responces acoding to the five observations and there are *N* number of lines.  
2. Inputs should be end with the **e** input and it is not case sensitive.

### Constraints
Inputs should be only five digits and those should include **X** or **O** .

### Output Format
The first observation must be true. If it does not, it should be displayed as "No Subsidies".  
Subsidies have been paid since 2000 for the other 4 observations on verification respectively.  
If not in constraints display nothing related that line.
